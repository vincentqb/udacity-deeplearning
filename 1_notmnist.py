By construction, this dataset might contain a lot of overlapping samples, including training data that's also contained in the validation and test set!

Measure how much overlap there is between training, validation and test samples.

Optional questions:
-- What about near duplicates between datasets? (images that are almost identical)
-- Create a sanitized validation and test set, and compare your accuracy on those in subsequent assignments.
